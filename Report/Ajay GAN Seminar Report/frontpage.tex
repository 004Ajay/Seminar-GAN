  \textbf{\large Abstract}
\end{center}
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of deep learning model that can generate new data, such as images, text, and audio, or enhance the quality of existing data. As a result, they have emerged as a transformative technology in the fields of machine learning and computer vision. GANs are a relatively new technology, but they already had a significant impact on the field of machine learning. GANs have been used to generate realistic images of human faces, translate languages, and create new forms of art and music, serving as a gateway to Generative AI. The introductory GAN has a simple architectural complexity, making it a vibrant research field to explore and create powerful systems. Many research efforts related to GANs are ongoing, and one noteworthy research paper that showcases the versatility of GANs is referred as a case-study for this seminar study. This research work enhances the interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in medical imaging, specifically for Pulmonary Edema and Liver Fibrosis. FIGAN utilizes a Conditional GAN (CGAN) to synthesize images that reveal CNN's learned features, making it a functional approach to interpreting medical images. This seminar explores the fascinating world of GANs, delving into their architecture, challenges, and applications, and a recent use case of GANs in-depth, highlighting their significance in generating synthetic data with remarkable realism.
